# Value a company

This is a small project I did for fun but also because it might come in handy in the future!

## Purpose

As a value investor one of your main sources of information to choose a company to invest in is to study its financial state.
This is exactly what this app tries to do. By showing some basic financial information the user can quickly see if a company is worth considering or not.
Current finantial info displayed (more to come):
- Debt to equity
- Current ratio
- Return on equity

## Architecture

The backend is divided in several microservices coded in NodeJS. For this app I've used AWS lambda and API Gateway. The schema below gives an overview of the architecture of this project:
